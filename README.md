# DevOps with Docker 2024

DevOps with Docker is an expansive three-part course provided by the ***University of Helsinki*** in collaboration with ***Eficode***. The course offers deep and practical knowledge of container technologies, particularly Docker, and container orchestration with Docker-Compose. Throughout the course, I learned about various components of web services, such as reverse proxies and databases, and how they can be deployed using Docker.

### Part 1: Introduction to Docker
This part provides an introduction to Docker and its utility in development, deployment, and scaling. The skills covered include:
- Running containerized applications and containerizing existing applications
- Utilizing volumes to store data persistently outside of containers
- Using port mapping to allow access to containerized applications via TCP
- Sharing user-created container images using online repositories like Docker Hub

### Part 2: Container Orchestration with Docker Compose
This part introduces container orchestration with Docker Compose and relevant concepts such as Docker networks. The skills covered include:
- Running multi-container applications that interact via HTTP
- Running a group of containers that interact via Docker volumes
- Manually scaling applications
- Using third-party services, such as databases, inside containers as part of your project

### Part 3: Production-Ready Practices
This part introduces production-ready practices such as container optimization and deployment pipelines. It also covers some security-related aspects of containerized applications. The skills covered include:
- Critically examining images from online image repositories
- Trimming container size and reducing image build time using methods such as multi-stage builds
- Automatically deploying images via GitHub Actions
- Familiarization with multi-host deployments

Completing this course was quite fun and provided me with hands-on experience with many essential Docker concepts such as Docker networking, volumes, scaling, and much more. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the University of Helsinki and Eficode for providing such a wonderful course.
